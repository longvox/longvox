## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a dedicated Software Engineer with a passion for creating efficient and scalable web applications. My main programming languages are JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP, and Golang. I thrive on solving complex problems and continuously learning new technologies.

#### ðŸŒŸ About Me:
I started my coding journey with a strong interest in web development. Over the years, I've honed my skills in various programming languages and frameworks. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think critically and push the boundaries of what is possible.

#### ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning:
I'm currently diving deeper into cloud-native technologies, specifically Kubernetes and Docker, to enhance my DevOps skills and better manage large-scale applications.

#### âš¡ Fun Fact:
When I'm not coding, I enjoy street photography and exploring new place. Both activities help me clear my mind and come back to work with fresh ideas.
